## Key Takeaways: 

- This article talks about implementing the concept of Lean into Software Development. Lean is a way to maximize value and minimize waste. It's a way to optimize people, time, resources and effort towards creating of value for the customer. Lean actually recently entered the realm of Software Development due its focus on optimizing the entire organization rather than small development teams. 

- The core principles of Lean in software development include eliminating waste, amplifying learning, making decisions as late as possible, delivering as fast as possible, empowering the team, building integrity into the software, and seeing the whole picture. In short, Lean deals with continuous improvement and generating respect for people. These principles emphasize efficiency, continuous improvement, and a customer-centric approach.

## Comment by Ryan Zhang

I found it really interesting that learning and acknowledgement that software developers will get better/have a better understanding of what is better for that project is explicitly built-in to Lean. The principles of *Amplify Learning* and *Decide as Late as Possible* encourage constant and active change. I can see how this grew out from Agile but also how it is fundamentally different.
